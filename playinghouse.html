            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>I made this project for my final assignment in my introduction to virtual reality class. The basic premise of my project is that the viewer is a doll, but they don’t know that. They
                go through a three sided house only to find out that, once the outside light turns on, they’re
                in a dollhouse and are a doll.<br><br>
                I came up with this project idea because I thought it was
                unique and special to VR. Experiencing the dollhouse in virtual reality would be an immsersive
                experience that conveys the feelings and emotions better than a short film could. Some
                of the themes are femininity, feeling trapped/feeling small, feeling unoriginal, and consumerism.<br><br>
                Dolls, throughout history, have been disputed figures both literally and figuratively. Some
                see them as enforcing a toxic mindset on young girls that indoctrinates them into an overly-
                feminine way of viewing women, others see dolls as empowering, How the viewer interprets
                this will depend on their preconceived notions of dolls, which I find interesting.<br><br>
                Another
                theme this experience will communicate is the feeling of being trapped/small. As a doll,
                one is quite literally smaller. The feeling of being in a dollhouse inside a box on a store shelf
                is meant to make you feel small and somewhat powerless. You’re made to feel small by your
                size and your position. It also makes one feel trapped. Another one of the themes in unoriginality.
                As a doll, you’re one of many, mass-produced and repeated. It’s hard to feel original
                when you live in the same house with the same furniture as ‘everyone else’ and you wear the
                same clothes and look the exact same.<br><br>
                One of my other themes is consumerism. The experience
                takes place in a dollhouse but overall on a store shelf. The experience is also representative
                of mass consumerism and overproduction as we often see in our current landscape.</p>
