                    <li>I chose the Archive of Our Own because I have an interest in media and fan culture.</li>
                    <li>The reason why I chose to create a mobile app design instead of a website redesign is because 97% of the traffic on the website is from mobile phones and because I wanted more experience with mobile app design.</li>
                    <li>The goal of this project was to improve upon the interface so that users had an easier time accessing fan works of interest and keeping up with ones they're currently reading .</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Archive of Our Own is run by the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) and is a nonprofit founded in 2007 devoted to serving the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fan works and cultures.</li>
                    <li>The Archive of Our Own is a nonprofit and noncommercial website that hosts an archive of fan works, or in other words, fan fiction.</li>
                    <li>The Archive of Our Own is best known for its elaborate tagging system. A tag is a keyword or phrase that refers to the content of the work that is put there by the author. Many fans elect to read a fan work based off of tags alone.</li>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>To conduct research, I found a post on a popular social media website that asked people what they would like to be improved about Archive of Our Own and what they have problems with. The post has over 150 replies and I went through 50 of them and analyzed them. I pinpointed what the most important problems were across the posts. I also tested Archive of Our Own for usability issues and to see if it was in alignment with several laws of UX.</p>

            <p>Many readers on Archive of Our Own are unable to easily find content that best suits their needs and are unable to keep track of the content and organize it due to the interface design. 
                <br><br>Some of the biggest problems I found from my research are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no way to sort subscriptions.</li>
                <li>The current tagging hierarchy is ineffective.</li>

            <h3>Atomic Design</h3>
            <p>In designing the mobile app, I decided to take an atomic design approach so that all my elements would be consistent. Atomic Design is a design methodology wherein you design in a hierarchical manner from the least complex to the most complex components. I decided to use two of the atomic design steps in my design process, atoms and molecules. Atoms are the building blocks of an interface and molecules are groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.  </p>

            <h3>App Map</h3>
            <p>In making a mobile app, it's important to know the ends and beginning of my design and what links lead where. I decided to create a basic 'app map' (the mobile app version of a site map) as a blueprint for my mobile app.</p>

            <h2>Optimize the Search Process</h2>
            <div class="AO3-quicksearch-grid">
            <p>The current search feature on the Archive of Our Own website is dismal. If I want to search for a character and type their name into the search bar, the search results will be sorted by 'best match' meaning that the results that display first will be of fan works with the characters name in the title. If I search for a tag using the search bar, it will do the same thing and return first fan works with the tag in the title. In order to further filter the results, I'd have to click the 'edit your search' button and manually input tags and fandoms I want. This is time consuming and it makes it hard for users to find fan works that are relevant to them.
                <br><br>In order to improve the search process for my mobile app, I did a complete redesign. The user still would be able to do a quick search as before by typing something into the search bar, but they could also choose to search for something in a more specific way. By the relationship the fan work revolves around, the fan works tags, the fandom (the piece of fiction the work takes place in), or the character(s) present in the fan work. While this may seem like more time and effort, it will ultimately save the user time and allow for their search results to be more relevant ot the type of fan works they'd like to read.

            <h3>Search by Pairing</h3>
            <p>Many users of Archive of Our Own like to read fan works that revolve around a relationship between two characters and come to the site specifically to read about this. I decided to create a feature where a user could search for fanworks by what pairing between characters they had. The search by pairing feature has two fields where you enter each character in the pairing. 
                <br><br> The next feature is that it asks the user to select a relationship 'level.' I created this feature because many of the posts I read during my research expressed a desire for their to be a pairing 'level' of sorts. This is because pairings are tagged without a level in the current tagging system making it so they all appear equally even though in the actual fiction, one of these pairings barely appears. By adding a pairing level this would solve the problem and make it so users will know if the pairing they're searching for and its subsequent results are the main focus of the fan work. Lastly, the user can opt to select a 'tag pack' which is a custom set of includable and excludable tags preselected by the user (they can also manually add tags as well).

            <h3>Search by Tags</h3>
            <p>One of the most unique features of Archive of Our Own are its tags. Tags are basically keywords that are linked to a fan work and allow the user to know what the fan work may contain and its general tone, among other things. The search by tag feature will allow users to search by tags. They first have the option to use one of their 'tag packs,' whicb is created in the tag manager and allows a user to determine what tags will and will not be included in a search.
                <br><br>The user can also manually select tags to include in their search. The reason I added this feature is because on the current website, you cannot easily enter more than one tag at a time and because it makes it no longer necessary to manually input them, saving the user time and emphasizing recognition over recall.

            <div class="AO3-managetagpacks-grid">
            <p>On the current Archive of Our Own website, it is hard to keep track of tags. Tags are the main way users can find fan works of interest and decide whether or not they want to read a fan work. In the current website design, a user can only favorite 20 tags at maximum and they can only block a tag during a search, which means that they manually have to block a tag every time they make a search. Some users may want to exclude a tag in their search because the content associated with that tag is upsetting or undesirable to them. 
                <br><br>My proposed solution to this problem was to make a feature wherein a user could make their own 'tag pack.' A tag pack is a predetermined set of tags that can be either included or excluded in a search and are chosen by the user. The user can make as many of them as they want and include and exclude as many tags as they want in each.

            <h3>Creating a Tag Pack</h3>
            <p>In the process of creating a tag pack, the user will first select an image to represent the pack (or leave it blank) then make a title and description for the tag pack. They can then manually select as many tags as they want to include and as many tags as they want to exclude. This solves the problem of users being exposed to tags they find unseemly as well as allowing users to further customize their search and receive more relevant and interesting results.

            <h2>Enhance Subscription Management</h2>
            <p>The current system for managing subscriptions on the Archive of Our Own website is subpar. When a user wishes to view their subscriptions, they are presented with a list of all of their subscriptions listed by title in alphabetical order. The reason this is ineffective is because most users don't tend to remember the fan work they read by its title, especially if it has been a long time, it is more productive to sort the subscriptions by what fandom they're based in or off of categories determined by the user.

            <p>In the current Archive of Our Own interface, there is no way for a user to sort their subscriptions which makes it hard for users to keep track of their subscriptions. To recitfy this, I've made 'shelves,' which are essentially libraries/saved lists of fan works the user is subscribed to. The user can create however many shelves they want with how ever many subscriptions that they want. </p>

            <h3>Bookmarks</h3>
            <p>On the current Archive of Our Own website, bookmarks are annotations and highlights of sorts that the user can make on fan works they've read. I've struggled with what to do with this feature because it is not necessary for the reading experience and is not used by many people, however, the people who do use it see it as very important to them. I decided to make it so the user can make bookmarks as they read and the bookmarks appear once they've selected a work, either from search results or, most commonly, their subscriptions. Additionally, in the current design, bookmarks are automatically public. In my app design, I'd change that to automatically private with the option to make them public. I'd do this in order to preserve the users privacy.

            <h3>Updates</h3>
            <p>The current system of alerting the user to an update on one of their subscriptions, is to send them an email. This is not ideal since it requires the user to use a different platform to stay caught up on information pertaining to the Archive of Our Own. This is not ideal and it would be better to keep all of the information on the Archive of Our Own. Additionally, Archive of Our Own does not keep track of the last chapter read.
                <br><br>To solve these problems, I've added a feed of subscription updates sorted by most recently updated for the user to view and keep up to date with their fan works. It is quite common for users to not remember the fan work based off it its title and author, so I've added further information such as the fandom and main pairing (if applicable). Also, I've added a field that tells the user the last chapter of the fan work they read, so that they can keep track of what they've read.
