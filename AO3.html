                <ul>
                    <li>This is a self project that I chose to do on my own.</li>
                    <li>I chose the Archive of Our Own because I have an interest in media and fan culture.</li>
                    <li>The reason why I chose to create a mobile app design instead of a website redesign is because 97% of the traffic on the website is from mobile phones and because I wanted more experience with mobile app design.</li>
                    <li>The goal of this project was to improve upon the interface so that users had an easier time accessing fan works of interest and keeping up with ones they're currently reading .</li>

                <h3>About Archive of Our Own</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Archive of Our Own is run by the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) and is a nonprofit founded in 2007 devoted to serving the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fan works and cultures.</li>
                    <li>The Archive of Our Own is a nonprofit and noncommercial website that hosts an archive of fan works, or in other words, fan fiction.</li>
                    <li>The Archive of Our Own is best known for its elaborate tagging system. A tag is a keyword or phrase that refers to the content of the work that is put there by the author. Many fans elect to read a fan work based off of tags alone.</li>

            <h2>Research of the Problem</h2>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>To conduct research, I found a post on a popular social media website that asked people what they would like to be improved about Archive of Our Own and what they have problems with. The post has over 150 replies and I went through 50 of them and analyzed them. I pinpointed what the most important problems were across the posts. I also tested Archive of Our Own for usability issues and to see if it was in alignment with several laws of UX.</p>
            <!---image-->
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Many readers on Archive of Our Own are unable to easily find content that best suits their needs and are unable to keep track of the content and organize it due to the interface design. 
                <br><br>Some of the biggest problems I found from my research are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no way to sort subscriptions.</li>
                <li>The current tagging hierarchy is ineffective.</li>
                <li>The Search Process is inconsistent and hard to use.</li>
                <li>It is hard for users to find where they last read a fan work.</li>
                <li>There is an overall lack of user control and freedom</li>
            </ul>
