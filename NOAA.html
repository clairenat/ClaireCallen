            <ul>
                <li>This redesign was a class assignment.</li>
                <li>We were given the option of redesigning one of NOAA's four main tools on the GLANSIS Website: The Species List Generator, Map Explorer, Risk Assessment Clearinghouse, or Educator Hub.</li>
                <li>I chose to redesign the Species List Generator because it is NOAA's most important and most used tool.</li>
                <li>The goal of this project was to solve the problems with the Species List Generator and improve upon its visual design.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also known as NOAA, is a scientific and regulatory agency that works within the United States Department of Commerce; they deal with forecasting weather, monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions, managing fishing and protection of marine mammals and endangered species within the US, and much more. </li>
                <li>The Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System (GLANSIS), is a website created by NOAA that is an online database of nonindigenous species in the Great Lakes.</li>
                <li>The Species List Generator is a tool on the GLANSIS website that allows you to search for a species.</li>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Managers, researchers, and educators are burdened by the Glansis website’s complex and ineffectual design. Resulting in many of the managers, researchers, and educators being unable to find the necessary information they’re looking for.</p>

            <h2>Redesign Results Page</h2>
            <p>The search results page’s initial design is outdated, clunky,  confusing, and not mobile friendly. Each entry appears as it would on desktop so you would have to zoom in to get a clear look at the information. In order to view one of the profiles, you can’t click anywhere on that species’ entry, but you have to click on the scientific name specifically. Furthermore, this also violates Fitt’s law because the size of the target is too small. Additionally, in order to sort the results, you have to click on the top of the column associated with that category. This violates Jakob’s law because this function does not match those used on other sites and would likely confuse the user.
                <br><br>In my redesign, I focused on fixing these issues. For one, I made it so only the image of the species, scientific name, and common name are displayed so as not to confuse and overwhelm users. Additionally, you can click anywhere on the entry (the image and/or the name) in order to proceed to its profile. This also makes it so the design now aligns with Fitt’s law. I have also added a sort by drop down button to the page so that users will be able to easily understand that they can sort their results. This makes it so the design now aligns with Jakob’s law.

            <h2>Reorganize Search Page</h2>
            <p>The search page’s initial design is outdated, misaligned, and overwhelming. The appearance is outdated and most of the drop down menus are misaligned, making it look unorganized. Additionally, by having such a great number of filters on its initial search page, it violates Hick’s law, which states that “the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available.”
                <br><br>To combat the violation of Hick’s law, I made it so the user would first be presented with just a search bar for the common name, the ‘sort by’ drop down menu, and a ‘more filters’ option. Once they click on ‘more filters’ the rest of the filters will be displayed. By having most of the filters only be displayed if the user chooses to, I diminish the interface’s ability to overwhelm the user and make it so there is more user control and freedom.

            <h2>Simplify Profile Page</h2>
            <p>The profile page’s initial design is clunky, unintuitive and not mobile friendly. In the initial profile page design, the information is presented all in one big chunk with seemingly no chunking or information hierarchy. This also slightly violates Hick’s law by overwhelming the user and making it harder for them to find information due to its unsorted nature.
                <br><br>To make it easier to find information, I made dropdown’s for the mobile version wherein if someone is looking for information related to ‘Management,’ instead of having to scroll down the whole page, they can just scroll down to the ‘Management’ dropdown and select it, the information will then be displayed under that category. Similarly, for the desktop design, there is a table of contents which allows for the user to easily navigate to the category of their choosing. These changes make it so the user can find information more quickly and easily than before.

            <h2>Improve Visual Appearance</h2>
            <p>NOAA's current interface is outdated and unappealing. The clients themselves said that the interface has not been updated since it was created, which was likely some time in the 2000's. One of the major goals of this project was to revamp the interface and give it a modern design.</p>

            <p>When creating the first iteration of my redesign, I mainly focused on fixing issues with the interface and not the visual design. Upon completing my initial design, reviewing feedback, and receiving more information about what is needed on the interface from my client, I took a step back and thought long and hard about how to approach this project.<br><br> I believe that my initial design had merits when it came to the design itself, but visually, it was nowhere near where it needed to be. My thought process was too inside the box and what I had created was basically just a more modern version of their current interface. I needed to start over.</p>
            <h3>Starting Over</h3>
            <p>I scrapped everything I had and started over. I did research and viewed several different websites for inspiration for the visual design of my interface. I had also received feedback from the client that guided my redesign. For one, the client made it clear that the partner logos had to be included and that the footer links could not be changed.<br><br> In my original design, I got rid of the partner logos and reorganized the footer links, so in my redesign I made sure to find a way to include them in a visually appealing way. Additionally, the client stated that many users simply use the website to view the number of results generated by the Species List Generator. I had initially gotten rid of this so I made sure to include it in my redesign as well as emphasize it visually. </p>

            <h3>Creating a Visual Identity</h3>
            <p>After finishing my wireframes, it was imperative that I craft a Visual Identity for my product. I decided to center the visual identity around the NOAA logo so that the GLANSIS site will have a clear relation to, and match visually with, other NOAA products.</p>
